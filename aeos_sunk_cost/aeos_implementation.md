# AEOS (Autonomous Empirical Optimization System) — Implementation Plan

## 1. What is AEOS?

The **AEOS (Autonomous Empirical Optimization System)** is an implementation of the AI In The Loop (AITL) pattern. Instead of a human writing code, analyzing logs, and tweaking parameters, AEOS is given a raw dataset and a goal. It autonomously:
1.  Chooses model architectures (sklearn, PyTorch, Ensembles).
2.  Writes the training and evaluation code.
3.  Executes the code and reviews the results (Validation Accuracy / Loss).
4.  Decides whether to pivot to a new strategy, tweak the current one, or **satisfy itself and stop** when it believes no further gains can be made without overfitting.

## 2. What we are doing (The Goal)

For the upcoming AITL V2 paper, we are upgrading AEOS from a single-agent loop to a **Multi-LLM Autonomous Research Lab**. 

We want to answer the core research question: **How do different LLMs (Claude, Gemini, Local APIs) perform in a fully autonomous loop? How do their self-satisfaction and convergence criteria differ?**

### The Zero-Human Sandbox (AITL Extreme)
To achieve true "AI In The Loop," we will completely remove human existence from the execution sandbox. We will introduce an **Orchestrator/Reviewer Agent**. 
*   **The Observer (Us):** We only watch the logs.
*   **The Orchestrator (AI):** It writes the terminal commands, triggers `runner.py` with different models, reads the results, and if a run crashes or plateaus, it autonomously diagnoses the issue and restarts the pipeline with a new strategy. 
*   **The Timeout:** It pauses for 10 seconds before executing a massive action. If the human (Observer) doesn't explicitly interrupt, the AI proceeds.

### What more we can do with AEOS:
1.  **Multi-LLM Benchmarking**: Compare how Gemini, Claude, and Local Models navigate the exact same dataset autonomously.
2.  **Cross-Model Handoff (Ensembling)**: Start the loop with a fast local model to find a baseline. When it plateaus, hand the codebase and history over to Claude for deep feature engineering.
3.  **Optuna/Hyperparameter Generation**: Instead of the LLM hardcoding hyperparameters, it autonomously writes `optuna` trials.
4.  **Continuous Self-Healing**: The Orchestrator agent monitors the `runner.py` output. If `runner.py` completely crashes due to an environment issue, the Orchestrator reads the stack trace, fixes the environment, and runs it again.

## 3. How we proceed (Step-by-Step)

Since AEOS is a self-contained environment and highly experimental, it is the perfect starting point before tackling more complex downstream production systems.

### Phase 1: Litellm Integration & Multi-Backend Support
*   Update `agent.py` to use `litellm`.
*   Ensure we can seamlessly swap between `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, and local Ollama models by just passing a `--model` flag in the runner.
*   Log the token usage and cost for API models to calculate the "Cost per 1% of Accuracy".

### Phase 2: The Orchestrator Agent (Zero-Human Sandbox)
*   Build `orchestrator.py`, a supreme agent that runs outside the main loop.
*   It has access to Python's `subprocess` module to run `runner.py` with different flags autonomously.
*   It implements a 10-second countdown before executing its next decision, allowing us (the Observers) to intervene. If we don't, it acts autonomously.

### Phase 3: Benchmarking & Data Collection
*   Run the AEOS loop on our classification datasets using 3 different models independently.
*   Generate combined plots showing the learning curves (Accuracy vs Iteration) for Claude vs Gemini vs Local.
*   This data will form the core of the AEOS section in the AITL V2 paper.

# Paper 2: The Agent-Critic Architecture (Thinker/Coder Dual-Agent System)

While Phase 1 (Paper 1) proved that models suffer from an "Autonomous Sunk-Cost Fallacy," Phase 2 introduces an architectural solution. We transition AEOS from a single autonomous agent to an asymmetric **Agent-Critic** dual-agent system.

## 1. The Core Hypothesis
Relying on a single LLM's internal alignment to write code, evaluate its own work, and decide when to stop is fundamentally flawed. By separating the cognitive load into a "Thinker" (Reviewer) and a "Worker" (Coder), we can eliminate the Sunk-Cost Fallacy and force computationally efficient early stopping.

## 2. Architecture & Roles

*   **The Thinker (ReviewerAgent):** `ministral:14b`
    *   **Role:** Analyzes the execution history (metrics, code snippets, errors).
    *   **Authority:** It never writes code. It issues high-level **Directives** ("Pivot to an SVM") and exclusively controls the `STOP` command (F6).
*   **The Worker (CoderAgent):** `deepseek-v2:16b`
    *   **Role:** Receives the Directive and translates it into valid Python code. 
    *   **Authority:** It possesses zero meta-reasoning about the loop's progress. It simply executes the strategy.

## 3. Key Research Questions for Paper 2

1.  **Communication Protocol:** How effectively can the Thinker's abstract strategy directives be translated into concrete implementations by the Coder without information loss?
2.  **The F6 Authority:** Will the Thinker (`ministral:14b`) accurately recognize a mathematical plateau and forcefully terminate the loop, preventing the Coder from entering a Sunk-Cost loop?
3.  **Value-Add of the Thinker:** Does a 14B reasoning model actually provide better architectural pivoting and error diagnosis than a monolithic code model, or does it merely provide a better stopping mechanism?
4.  **Agentic Economics:** Does the dual-agent overhead (two LLM calls per iteration) result in a net savings of compute tokens due to earlier stopping and fewer wasted runs?

## 4. Testing Methodology

To validate the Agent-Critic architecture for Paper 2, we must conduct the following tests:
1.  **The Baseline Comparison:** Run the dual-agent `runner_critic.py` loop on the Tabular and Vision datasets.
2.  **Sunk-Cost Measurement:** Count the number of Sunk-Cost episodes (iterations with no improvement and no architectural pivot) in the dual-agent system and compare it to the single-agent Boundless runs from Paper 1.
3.  **Directive Analysis:** Qualitatively log and analyze the Reviewer's "Reasoning" blocks to track exactly *why* it decided to pivot or stop.
